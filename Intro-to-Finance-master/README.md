![Michael Katchen](Images/michael.jpg) 

A: WealthSimple was founded by [Michael Katchen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkatchen/?originalSubdomain=ca) in 2014.

__*Q: How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*__

A: Prior to founding Wealthsimple, Michael Katchen worked for 1000Memories, a Silicon Valley-based startup. After Ancestry.com bought 1000Memories in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios.  Michael has been interested in investing since 12 years old, and the acquision of 1000Memories helped him get enough money to try his investing ideas out. During an interview with [Omri Barzilay](https://www.forbes.com/sites/omribarzilay/#b55dd075ee9f), Michael talked about his early experience prior to launching WealthSimple:

> Before starting Wealthsimple, I worked at a YC-backed startup called 1000memories, and we sold the business to Ancestry.com in 2012. When that happened, the team I was working with came into a little money for the first time and wasn't sure what to do with it. I've been interested in investing since I was 12 and offered to help them build a simple portfolio, which I did one evening with a spreadsheet. Their feedback was, “This looks like a great plan, but can you just do it for me?” And they became Wealthsimple's first customers.

Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple and in 2014, he returned to Toronto to launch the company. [2]

__*Q: How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*__

A: There have been six rounds of funding since 2015 and majority of funding comes from Power Financial. [3]

__*Q: What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?*__

And the level of support is related to the client tiers.  Specifically, financial planning and goal setting is available to their Wealthsimple Generation tier, though they offer simple financial advice to their basic users.

## Landscape

__*Q: What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*__

WealthSimple focuses on several financial fields: investment management, personal finance and trading. Specifically, [__Wealthsimple Invest__](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/product/invest/) is a robo-advisor that offers beginners or investors who prefer to be hands-off a choice of investment portfolios to suit their risk tolerance and financial goals.

And [__Wealthsimple Cash__](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/product/cash/) is the newest addition—it’s a no-fee hybrid chequing and savings account.

__*Q: What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*__

A: Artificial intelligence has been innovating investment management since the last decade and the robo-advisors powered by the fast-growing field of artificial intelligence (AI), which is able to process and interpret vast amounts of data at lightning speed, are eroding independent firms' market share and becomes more and more appealing to tech-savvy investors preferring the low-cost model and the mobile convenience that robos offer.

Initially offered by startups, robos are now part of the suite of services offered by major financial institutions such as *Vanguard*, *Schwab* and *Fidelity*. Since they are less expensive than a human advisor, they democratize access to financial advice.
